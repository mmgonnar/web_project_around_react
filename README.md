# Tripleten web_project_around Create with React App

## Description

This project is part of the [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/es-mex/) web development bootcamp curriculum. It showcases the skills and techniques learned throughout the course, demonstrating proficiency in front-end development using React.

Around The U.S. is an interactive web application that allows users to explore and share interesting locations across the United States. It serves as a practical application of modern web development concepts and best practices, including responsive design, component-based architecture, and API integration.

## Features

- User's profile with an "Edit" button to update the profile information and avatar.
- A list of attractive cards that can be liked with the "Like" or "Deleted" button.

## Techniques Used

- **Responsive design:** The web application is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.
- **BEM methodology:** The CSS classes follow the Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention for better organization and maintainability of styles.
- **Flexbox:** Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts throughout the application.
- **Grid layout:** Implemented for organizing card elements in a responsive grid structure.
- **Event handling:** JavaScript is used to handle user interactions such as button clicks and form submissions.
- **State management:** React's useState hook is utilized to manage the application's state, including user information and card data.
- **Component-based architecture:** The application is built using React components, promoting reusability and modularity.
- **Popup modals:** Implemented for editing profile information and viewing enlarged images.
- **Form validation:** Client-side form validation is used to ensure data integrity before submission.
- **API integration:** The application communicates with a backend API to fetch and update user and card data.
